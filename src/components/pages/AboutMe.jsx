      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        I started learning minimal coding skills in 2017, enough to customize
        Wordpress pages for friends who needed some help on their personal sites
        but whom had no technical skills of their own. This slowly developed into
        a genuine interest in learning how to build and deploy webpages. I began
        learning software engineering skills in a formal classroom in 2020, and got
        my degree in New Media and Technology with a concentration in Computation in 2023.
        Although I learned the basics in a classroom, I felt as though I needed more
        intensive and in-depth learning, which drew me to Columbia's Software Engineering 
        Bootcamp in the summer of 2024.
